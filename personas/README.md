| Goals and Tasks | He is hard-working individual with 25+ years in his field. Dale is a frugal and honest man that doesn't like fixing things that don't need to be fixed. He will occasionally stay late to clean and mop the floors of the garage.<br><br>During work, he spends his time:<br>- Diagnosing car troubles<br>- Ordering parts for repairs<br>- Coaching junior mechanics<br>- Cleaning his work area between jobs                                                                                                   |
| Environment     | He is slowly getting comfortable with using a smart phone; mostly because of his teenage boys. He mostly uses the pre-installed apps on his iPhone including "Phone", "Messages", and "Safari". Even though he can download the "Facebook" app, he still checks his profile using the default web browser app.<br><br>Dale tends to get frustrated easily when things "just don't work". Since the dealership IT guy can't fix his computer problems, he usually calls one of his teenage boys for tech support. |
