# Wireframes and Personas
When building a website or a web application, it is important to plan out as best as you can. Ideally, before 
putting finger tips to keyboard, you should have a general layout drawn up and have target audiences identified. After 
all, it's your job as a web developer to solve the problems of your audience or client's audience.

## Assignment
Your assignment is to create a number of personas and wireframes for a local pizzeria, Cocca's Pizza. The website 
should make it easy for users to view their menu, prices, nutritional information, etc. In addition to viewing the 
menu...the website should also be easy for anyone to navigate to and order online.

In this repo, you will find some stock portraits of some individuals, presumably from different backgrounds and 
income levels. You may use these or you may use your own portraits. If you decide to use your own portraits, be sure 
to have a diverse collection of "people" to personify.

In addition to personas, you will also be asked to provide some wireframes for some pages of of the website. These 
can be created in any software such as Photoshop, Figma, Adobe XD, etc. You may also hand draw your wireframes if 
you wish. If you hand draw your wireframes, be sure they are scanned and added to this repo.

When complete, you repository should contain the following:

- A document (`.md`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.pdf`) with at least _three_ personas
- A collection of images or PDFs of your wireframes.
  - You must have _two_ different wireframes for the "home" page
  - You must have _two_ different wireframes for the "menu" page
  - You must have _two_ different wireframes for a "generic content" page (could be a blog post, about us, contact, 
    etc.)
